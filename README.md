# Machine Learning Guide to practice
Easy to read guide to Machine Learning from statistic concept to practice with real world data

## Contents

1. Intro to Machine Learning

  * Explain the difference between the outcome and the features.
  * Explain when to use classification and when to use prediction.
  * Start to use the caret package.
  * Construct and interpret a confusion matrix.
  * Use conditional probabilities in the context of machine learning.

2. Linear Regression for Prediction

  * Use linear regression for prediction as a baseline approach.
  * Use logistic regression for categorical data.
  * Detect trends in noisy data using smoothing (also known as curve fitting or low pass filtering).

3. Distance, Knn, Cross Validation, and Generative Models

  * Use the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm.
  * Understand the problems of overtraining and oversmoothing.
  * Use cross-validation to reduce the true error and the apparent error. 
  * Use generative models such as naive Bayes, quadratic discriminant analysis (qda), and linear discriminant analysis (lda) for machine learning.
