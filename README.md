# Machine Learning Guide to practice
Easy to read guide to Machine Learning from statistic concept to practice with real world data

## Contents

### 1. Intro to Machine Learning

  * Explain the difference between the **outcome** and the **features**.
  * Explain when to use **classification** and when to use prediction.
  * Start to use the caret package.
  * Construct and interpret a confusion matrix.
  * Use conditional probabilities in the context of machine learning.

### 2. Linear Regression for Prediction

  * Use **linear regression** for prediction as a baseline approach.
  * Use **logistic regression** for categorical data.
  * Detect trends in noisy data using smoothing (also known as curve fitting or low pass filtering).

### 3. Distance, Knn, Cross Validation, and Generative Models

  * Use the **k-nearest neighbors (kNN)** algorithm.
  * Understand the problems of overtraining and oversmoothing.
  * Use **cross-validation** to reduce the true error and the apparent error. 
  * Use **generative models** such as naive Bayes, quadratic discriminant analysis (qda), and linear discriminant analysis (lda) for machine learning.
  
### 4. Classification with More than Two Classes

  * Use classification and **regression trees**.
  * Use classification (decision) trees.
  * Apply **random forests** to address the shortcomings of decision trees. 
  * Use the caret package to implement a variety of machine learning algorithms.

### 5. Model Fitting and Recommendation Systems Overview

  * Apply the methods we have learned to an example, the MNIST digits.
  * Build a movie recommendation system using machine learning.
  * Penalize large estimates that come from small sample sizes using regularization.
